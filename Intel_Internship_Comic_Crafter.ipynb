                This AI comic generator creates a **4-part narrative structure**:

                1. **INTRODUCTION**: Sets the scene and characters
                2. **STORYLINE**: Develops the plot with challenges
                3. **CLIMAX**: The most intense moment of conflict
                4. **RESOLUTION**: Concludes with a lesson or message

                Each image is carefully generated to match its place in the story!

        ## 💡 Tips for Success
        - Use descriptive prompts with clear characters and action
        - Try different art styles to match your story's mood
        - For best results, use the full 4-panel story structure
        - Comics follow classic narrative patterns: introduction → conflict → climax → resolution
